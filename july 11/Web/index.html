        <font size="6">What are IT services?</font><br>
    <font size="3">Information technology (IT) services are the services that allow businesses to access the technical tools and information they use for their operational processes and daily tasks. Often, teams with expertise in IT or computer science manage these services for organizations in many industries. Depending on an organization's business type, IT services team can either comprise internal teams or external IT teams. For instance, in the medical field, an IT team for a hospital may provide services that keep hospital databases operational and easy to use for staff members. In a small business setting, IT services can include online storage accounts for business data and network security for transactions over the internet.</font> <br><br>
    <font size="6">13 examples of IT services</font> <br>
    <font size="3">There are many IT services that can benefit businesses and help them operate smoothly and efficiently. Many of these services allow employees to interact with technology that helps them perform their on-the-job duties or communicate with each other. Some of the most common types of IT services used in businesses include:</font><br>
    <font size="5">1. Cloud services</font><br>
    <font size="3">Cloud services provide many ways for business team members to interact with the technology they need. The cloud is an internet-connected platform that can store and access information and programs. Since the cloud stores the information instead of holding it on a computer, team members can access and use it whether at home or in the office. Some cloud services can even run operation systems remotely, allowing team members to use internal business programs remotely without installing them on their computers.</font><br>
    <font size="5">2. Voice over internet protocol (VoIP)</font><br>
    <font size="3">Voice over internet protocol is a communication tool for businesses. VoIP allows team members to make calls and send messages through their internet connections instead of through a phone line. This helps with internal long-distance communication for businesses that may have offices in different locations. Most VoIP services require paid subscriptions, which businesses can use with traditional phone services or as an alternative.</font> <br>
